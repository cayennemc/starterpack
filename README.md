# StarterPack
StarterPack will allow you to make a starter kit that is given to each player when they first log on to the server.

## Features
You can give out absolutely any items, with any name and other attributes, since StarterPack fully uses the NBT format.

You can install this mod on your server to give players an initial set, or on the client to get the necessary items for the initial stages of the game.

## Configuration
The configuration is located in `<game or server directory>/config/starterpack.json`.

You can read more about the configuration [here](https://github.com/cayennemc/starterpack/wiki/Mod-configuration-and-features/).

Here you can find various [examples](https://github.com/cayennemc/starterpack/wiki/Ready-made-examples).
